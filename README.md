# ♟️ Road to 1100: A Chess Climb Journal

Welcome to my personal chess improvement project! This site is a living journal of my quest to reach an 1100 rating on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/). Along the way, I’ll be logging every game—win, loss, or draw—and reflecting on what I learn from each one. The goal isn’t just to hit a number, but to grow as a player through consistent practice and thoughtful analysis.

## 🌐 Project Description

**Road to 1100** is a static website that tracks my progress as I work toward an 1100 rapid rating on Chess.com. It’s part performance tracker, part personal journal, and part interactive dashboard. The site is built with modularity and clarity in mind, reflecting my love for clean design and creative storytelling.

### 🔍 Features

- 📅 **Game Log**: A chronological list of all games played, including:
  - Date
  - Opponent rating
  - Result (W/L/D)
  - Rating change
