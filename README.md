# road-to-1100
Welcome to my personal chess improvement project! This site is a living journal of my quest to reach an 1100 rating on Chess.com. Along the way, I’ll be logging every game—win, loss, or draw—and reflecting on what I learn from each one. The goal isn’t just to hit a number, but to grow as a player through consistent practice and thoughtful analysis.
